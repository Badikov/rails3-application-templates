h3. These application templates are deprecated (no longer maintained).

h3. Use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool instead. The Rails Composer tool creates the example applications for the RailsApps project. The tool gives you a Rails 3.2 starter app you can deploy in minutes.

Follow the project on Twitter: "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps. Please tweet some praise if you like what you've found.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h2. Creating a Starter App

To build a Rails application, run the command (where @myapp@ is the name of your application):

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

You can use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files or the @-O@ flag to skip Active Record files:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T -O
</pre>

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use a template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use a template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Check the "issues for the rails_apps_composer gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues.

You should review the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html to make sure you've updated all the components that are required to run Rails successfully.

h4. Problems with  "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h4. Problems with "Segmentation Fault"

If you get a "segfault" when you try @rails new@, try removing and reinstalling rvm.

h2. Documentation and Support

The application templates are assembled from recipes supplied by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. See the rails_apps_composer project to understand how the application templates work.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to change a template to generate an app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.
